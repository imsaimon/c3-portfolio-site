            <h1>I ‘m a Viking Warrior</h1>
            <p>Between the 9th and 11th centuries, no one in Western Europe was safe from the Vikings’ barbarity. From Scandinavia to Scottish and English shores, Brittany, and even the Americas, the Vikings sailed the seas and invaded the land they came across. One particular warrior chief made a name for himself as a fierce and cunning fighter, spreading terror everywhere he landed: Ragnar Lodbrok.</p>

            <h2>About Vikings</h2>
            <p>Viking, also called Norseman or Northman, member of the Scandinavian seafaring warriors who raided and colonized wide areas of Europe from the 9th to the 11th century and whose disruptive influence profoundly affected European history. These pagan Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish warriors were probably prompted to undertake their raids by a combination of factors ranging from overpopulation at home to the relative helplessness of victims abroad. The Vikings were made up of landowning chieftains and clan heads, their retainers, freemen, and any energetic young clan members who sought adventure and booty overseas. At home these Scandinavians were independent farmers, but at sea they were raiders and pillagers. During the Viking period the Scandinavian countries seem to have possessed a practically inexhaustible surplus of manpower, and leaders of ability, who could organize groups of warriors into conquering bands and armies, were seldom lacking. These bands would negotiate the seas in their longships and mount hit-and-run raids at cities and towns along the coasts of Europe. Their burning, plundering, and killing earned them the name víkingr, meaning “pirate” in the early Scandinavian languages.</p>
